Enjoy the classic game of Tic Tac Toe with a subtle GitHub twist. Bring a friend. It was made for two.

## How to play
Easy. Visit this link now, or bookmark it for later: [https://ns-hvknoguqvc.now.sh](https://ns-hvknoguqvc.now.sh)

If you're wondering why the link is weirdâ€¦ As a simple and free way to deploy the app, I used the [now](https://zeit.co/now/) service.
